                <p>
                    This work proposes a method to improve the automated classification 
                    and detection of macular diseases using retinal Optical Coherence 
                    Tomography (OCT) images by utilizing the fusion of two pre trained deep
                     learning networks. The concatenation of feature vectors extracted from each of the
                      pre trained deep learning model 
                    is performed to obtain a long feature vector of the fused network.

                <h3>Retinal disease classification from OCT images using deep learning algorithms</h3>
                <p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive test that takes cross-section pictures
                     of the retina layer of the eye and allows ophthalmologists to diagnose based on the 
                     retina’s layers. Therefore, it is an important modality
                     for the detection and quantification of retinal diseases and retinal abnormalities.</p>

                <h3>Anterior chamber angle classification in anterior segment optical coherence
                     tomography images using hybrid attention based pyramidal convolutional network</h3>
                <p>As the main cause of irreversible visual impairment, angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) can be 
                    detected with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS–OCT). The automatic 
                    classification of anterior chamber angles (ACA) into closed angle, narrowed angle and open
                     angle in the AS–OCT images is highly significant for understanding glaucoma progression. </p>

                <p>Supervised deep learning has achieved prominent success in various diabetic macular edema (DME) 
                    recognition tasks from optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumetric images. A common problematic 
                    issue that frequently occurs in this field is the shortage of labeled data due to the expensive 
                    fine-grained annotations, which increases substantial difficulty in accurate analysis by supervised learning.</p>

                <p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality used to obtain a cross-sectional 
                    image of the retina for retinal disease diagnosis. Modern diagnosis systems use Convolutional Neural Networks. Our model increases the contrast in the residual connection,
                     so high contrast regions, such as the retinal layers, are prominent in feature maps.</p>

                <p>Eye problems can lead to vision loss and have a significant impact on daily life,
                     underscoring the critical importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent 
                     further damage and complications. A comprehensive segmentation-classification framework
                      – VisionDeep-AI is developed in the proposed work for retinal

                <p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the main causes of visual impairment in 
                    elderly people, with drusen and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) being two characterizing 
                    types of lesions. Based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), image classification can be used in AMD diagnosis,
                     while image segmentation is necessary for quantitative assessment of the lesion area.</p>

                <p>The most frequent cause of blindness in industrialized nations is age-related macular 
                    degeneration (AMD), particularly in persons over 60. In recent years in this field, three
                     key factors have led to an increase in the workload of experts and the healthcare system: 1
                      population aging worldwide prevalence, 2) AMD's chronic nature, and 3)
                     more widespread usage of the retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technology. </p>
